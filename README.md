Ableton Live 8 control script for the Korg Microkontrol

I used to own a Korg Microkontrol and adapted the APC40 control scripts (circa Live 8) to give produce a subset of that functionality on the Microkontrol.

I've uploaded them here for posterity, but no longer own a Microkontrol so can not confirm they work...

Full installation/usage instructions in the wacKMK_Ableton_Control_Surface_Manual.pdf document
